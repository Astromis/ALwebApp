# ALwebApp

This simple(somewhere disgusting) webApp demonstrate how to wrapp up the Active Learning library libact.
the implementation needs to improve because I haven't enough expirience with Flask
and some things seems to be strange, but it works.


The task is a categorization of sentences given the context (short text). 
An idea is to show an accessor the the whole text and sentence from this text.
So the accessor have to decide the category of sentence.
